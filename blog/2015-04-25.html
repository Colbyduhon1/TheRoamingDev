			  <p>Hello world, I begin this blog in the wee hours of the morning here in San Francisco, in the precious few hours where it is both ANZAC day (25th of April) here and in back at home. I imagine the centenary festivities were quite a sight today, and I hope I get a chance to show someone two-up in the next 24 hours. Regardless, lest we forget. </p>
			  <p>Today’s blog is going to be interspliced with random song lyrics from songs from my iPhone. 10 points if you know where they all come from (and when you get 1000 points, you get to cash them in for either a brownie or a commemorative, one time high-5 from me). </p>
			  <h3>Your Love Is My Drug</h3>
			  <p>Speaking of brownies, there’s one thing that has been an absolute culture shock for me since coming to California. The amount of marijuana that people smoke here! To give you some context, it’s currently legal for San Francisco to provide prescriptions for medical Marijuana. Amazingly, the number of people who have suddenly developed trouble sleeping and need a remedy for it has skyrocketed here as well. </p>
			  <p>The fact is, I can’t walk between where I’m staying and the train station without walking through a cloud of happy-but-hungry-but-sleepy-but-...what-was-I-saying gas. Now, no judgement here, and most people know that I’m a pretty straight edge guy (and with temperamental lungs, I can never be too careful), but this has been totally surprising for me. With that being said, crime is actually down, pot dealers are now thriving business owners, and the locals seem quite happy about the legislation, so I say - live and let live! I’m told that 4/20 (the American date for the 20th of April) was quite a spectacle in some parts of the city, I’ll let you work that one out on your own. </p>
			  <h3>A chair is not a house, and a house is not a home</h3>
			  <p>Unfortunately, hemp isn’t the only drug that’s prevalent in this city. Along with a meth addiction problem, so comes one of San Francisco’s most prominent and confronting features – the sheer magnitude of homeless people. I’m not talking ‘adorable Australian living in a traveller’s hostel who could always go back to living in his parent’s garage’ homeless. I mean toothless, street-urinating, yell at you for not giving them a dollar, talking to themselves, homeless. There’s quite a few near where I’m staying, but they actually seem fairly harmless for the most part. It’s just very confronting, especially when you come from a place like Canberra. So far I have given a few of them a few coins, but only when they’re really polite. Most people seemed to have hardened to them, but I am finding that I’m getting more and more sympathetic about it every day. </p>
			  <h3>Take my hand, we’ll make it I swear</h3>
			  <p>So I feel like I’m just beginning to understand what it means to be a real adult (spoiler alert – I don’t care for it that much). I’m finding that I try and wear as few different clothes as possible just so I can go as long as possible without doing a load of washing. And I don’t know if that makes me a normal person, or just totally gross. For the sake of my self-esteem though, I’m going to choose normal person!</p>
			  <p>I’m also becoming the master of public transport. I take the train basically everyday, and sometimes even cable cars (plus I took the ferry once!). The buses here suck as much as in Canberra, but if I had all forms of public transport mastered, they’d probably ask me to become mayor, and I have too many skeletons in my closet for that (for the record, I did not have sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky). </p>
			  <p>Have you heard the superstition that you should hold your breath when going under a tunnel? Well I finally understand where that comes from. You see, when you’re on a crowded train, and you’re not holding your breath for the entire ride, you’ll either contract some sort of rare bird flu (which I’m pretty sure I’ve done twice now) or you’ll smell something that you think belongs in a science experiment. So my tip for new players is either go do some laps at your local swimming pool to increase your lung capacity, or invest in a reasonably priced oxygen tank so you can handle the journey. Otherwise you might end up like me, who has had a runny nose for about 3 weeks now!</p>
			  <h3>We built this city on Rock and Roll</h3>
			  <p>So I have had some really amazing experiences this past fortnight, and I would hate to not share them with you! The first notable one comes from the mysterious land of ‘Japantown’, where I attended the Cherry Blossom Festival with my new friend Myles (super smart guy, went through ANU, now working in tech over here). The company was great, however the highlight for me was the enormous Hello Kitty jumping castle in which children seemed to enter and exit from her private parts... Watching this giant cat give birth to children was either oddly beautiful or horribly disturbing, however I haven’t quite decided which yet. </p>
			  <p>I went on a wonderful tour of the aquarium with my friend Rick, and got to see the San Francisco boardwalk at night. We also went country western dancing with my friend Tom, and let’s just say, I think I might have found my inner cowboy. I’ve gone over the Golden Gate Bridge, and I also had a surprisingly amazing ferry ride up to the beautiful county of Marin and met fellow Australian Adrian and his wife Liane. They took me in, let me use their WiFi and cooked me a beautiful dinner – what more could this traveller ever ask for! </p>
			  <p>I went on a spectacular moped ride today and saw some absolutely breathtaking places around the city, courtesy of Jack (the guy whose apartment I’m taking). Jack is going to Sydney for a month, so any suggestions about what he should do in Australia (or even offers to show him around) would be invaluable. The moped ride consisted of: a scenic ride through Golden Gate Park; a trip to the creatively named Ocean Beach; an exploration of cave tunnels in some beachside cliffs; observing some very fancy real estate (including Robin Williams’ old house); and a ride through a cool little hippy area. </p>
			  <h3>Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living</h3>
			  <p>This title is a little misleading by using the word ‘working’... </p>
			  <p>So, I’m interviewing for a few places at the moment, and in the meantime I’m doing some strategic/administrative work for a tech start-up. It’s called Distinc.tt and it’d essentially a social networking app for LGBT youth, giving them a place to vent and chat that’s not as exposed (or sexualised) as a traditional website. It’s pretty cool, and I’m definitely learning a lot about business that I didn’t know before I got here. I’ve also had a lot of introductions (some of them through Distinc.tt), and I have been asked to do a few coding tests, so I will keep you posted on how the job hunt is going.</p>
			  <h3>Because I knew you, I have been changed for good</h3>
			  <p>Unfortunately this week, I also had some very sad news from home. Gwenda Holt, my best friend’s nan who I knew well, passed away after several years of health issues. </p>
			  <center><img src="images/20150425-Gwenda.png" class="img-rounded" style="max-width:100%"/></br>
			  <p><em>Three of the sassiest women in Codie’s family, and of course, the beautiful Gwenda</em></p></center>
			  <p>Gwenda was a truly wonderful woman. She was kind hearted and so totally accepting of anyone and everyone. Truly, you’d never meet someone her age that was less racist, less homophobic and less judgemental, she just welcomed everyone with absolutely open arms. </p>
			  <p>It was very hard for me not be there for Codie and her family this week. I’ve been a part of that family for so long, and to not be there at the funeral was tough. I’ve heard the send off was wonderful and I know we will all remember her fondly. I’m sure this won’t be the last time that I wish I could pop home for just a little bit, but I hope that next time it’s for a joyous reason rather than a sad one. </p>
			  <p>As I said to Codie, I’m sure she’s on the Potter’s bus to heaven now.</p>
			  <h3>These wings were made to fly</h3>
			  <p>While we pause to remember Gwenda - just like the ANZAC’s on this historic day - we must remember to keep moving forward. Like it or not, the adventure continues.  And so I will keep having adventures, continue to be amazed everyday, and as always, I will try to keep you posted on how it’s all going. Sending all my love back home this week, and until next time, appreciate these fabulous people around you! </p>
