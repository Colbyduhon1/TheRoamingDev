				"fullText":"The Frankly Next Gen Web Project created a platform for local news stations to provide their news content to readers in a way that was fast, flexible and accessible. We used an isomorphic javascript server with a React.js frontend to create a rich experience for users, as well as having a much faster load time than previous solutions. <br /> The challenge we faced with this project was trying to make a platform flexible enough that a station could make the site look any way they wanted, while still being opinionated enough that it saved stations time and money when it came to design and development. <br />This web platform supports roughly 5.1 million daily active users, across 200 local news stations across the United States.

Additionally, a JavaScript SDK was created which provided a direct interface to Frankly's Chat platform. This SDK allowed developers to create web applicationsand hook directly into our real-time chat platform. <br /> The Frankly Web Chat platform operated over websockets, updated itself in realtime, and was entirely responsive across devices and screen sizes. A sophisticated backend was created which dynamically used resources as it was needed, preventing the chat service to be a bottleneck in any application that was using it. <br /> An Admin Console was developed alongside the Web Chat platform to allow customers to handle customizations, moderation and configurations of their chat applications. This console handled all interactions with the chat service at an administrators level, and could make changes to all frontend clients for a customers application. <br /> The Frankly Web App was used as the official United Nation's International Day of Peace communication mechanism, and these web products supported clients such as Victoria Secret and the Sacramento Kings.

				"fullText":"I wrote this thesis as part of my Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours) Degree at ANU, in 2014. The goal of this project was to investigate the feasibility of interdisciplinary knowledge sharing for the purposes of improving software development practices. Mental health was identified as a candidate discipline, with emphasis on Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR). CBPR was identified as being similar in nature to Agile Software Development, and this link was investigated. </br> An exploratory case study was designed and executed in order to investigate links between the two practices. Experts were interviewed in each field. A general systems model was created in order to facilitate the interviews conducted throughout the case study. This model was representative of both Agile and CBPR, and was used to identify commonalities and differences between the two sets of practices.</br>Major findings from the study include: Participants from both software engineering and mental health research suggested practices from their own domains that may help external disciplines; Participants generally identified that their research areas were inward focused and/or silo-based; Potential opportunities from software engineering and mental health research to collaborate were identified, particularly in the areas of communication techniques, approaches to system development, and approaches to handling time constraints.</br> Knowledge sharing between software engineering and mental health research was considered feasible, and recommendations were given regarding future interdisciplinary work within software engineering.
